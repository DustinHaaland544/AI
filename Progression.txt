The progression of Artificial Intelligence (AI) over time is unlikely to be linear. It is more likely to follow an exponential or S-shaped curve. An exponential growth 
curve would suggest that the progress of AI is accelerating at a faster rate over time, which is what many experts believe is happening. An S-shaped curve would indicate 
that the progress of AI is starting slow, accelerating rapidly in the middle, and then slowing down again as the technology approaches its limits.

There are several factors that are contributing to the exponential growth of AI, including the increasing availability of data, improvements in hardware, and advancements
in AI algorithms. The growth of AI is being driven by the development of machine learning algorithms, which allow computers to learn from data and improve their 
performance over time.

It is important to note that while the progression of AI is likely to be exponential, there will likely be fluctuations and slowdowns along the way, as the technology 
faces technical and ethical challenges, and as society grapples with the implications of AI's rapid growth. Overall, however, the trend is likely to be towards continued 
exponential growth in the capabilities of AI.
