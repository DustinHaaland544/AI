An object-relational database (ORD) is a type of database that combines elements of both object-oriented and relational database models.

In a relational database, data is organized into tables consisting of rows and columns. Each table represents an entity or relationship between entities in the data, and 
the data is stored in a structured manner. However, relational databases are not ideal for representing complex data relationships, and they may not be able to handle 
large amounts of data efficiently.

On the other hand, object-oriented databases store data as objects, which can be thought of as instances of a class in an object-oriented programming language. This 
approach allows for more flexible and natural representation of complex data relationships, but it can also be less efficient for certain types of queries.

An ORD attempts to combine the strengths of both approaches by allowing the user to define complex data types and relationships, while still using a traditional 
table-based schema to store and query the data. An ORD allows developers to work with complex data types, such as arrays, lists, and even user-defined types, which are 
not available in traditional relational databases. Additionally, an ORD supports inheritance and encapsulation, which are important concepts in object-oriented 
programming.

The main difference between an ORD and other databases is the ability to handle complex data types and relationships while still retaining the advantages of a traditional
relational database, such as scalability, efficiency, and ease of use. This makes an ORD an attractive option for applications that require the handling of complex data 
structures, such as scientific research, financial analysis, and multimedia storage and retrieval.


Object-relational databases (ORD) were first developed in the late 1980s and early 1990s as a way to combine the benefits of both relational and object-oriented
databases. The concept of an ORD involves adding object-oriented features to a relational database management system (RDBMS), such as support for complex data types,
inheritance, and polymorphism.

The first commercially available object-relational database management system was Illustra, which was developed by Illustra Information Technologies and released in
1992. Illustra was a full-featured RDBMS that also provided support for object-oriented programming constructs and features, such as object types, methods, and
encapsulation.

Other notable object-relational database systems that were developed around the same time include O2 from Objectivity, ObjectStore from Object Design, and GemStone from
GemStone Systems. These systems were designed to support the storage and retrieval of complex object structures and to provide high performance for object-oriented
applications.

Today, many popular database management systems, such as Oracle, PostgreSQL, and Microsoft SQL Server, include support for object-relational features and are often
referred to as ORDBMS.
