An object-relational database (ORD) is a type of database that combines elements of both object-oriented and relational database models.

In a relational database, data is organized into tables consisting of rows and columns. Each table represents an entity or relationship between entities in the data, and 
the data is stored in a structured manner. However, relational databases are not ideal for representing complex data relationships, and they may not be able to handle 
large amounts of data efficiently.

On the other hand, object-oriented databases store data as objects, which can be thought of as instances of a class in an object-oriented programming language. This 
approach allows for more flexible and natural representation of complex data relationships, but it can also be less efficient for certain types of queries.

An ORD attempts to combine the strengths of both approaches by allowing the user to define complex data types and relationships, while still using a traditional 
table-based schema to store and query the data. An ORD allows developers to work with complex data types, such as arrays, lists, and even user-defined types, which are 
not available in traditional relational databases. Additionally, an ORD supports inheritance and encapsulation, which are important concepts in object-oriented 
programming.

The main difference between an ORD and other databases is the ability to handle complex data types and relationships while still retaining the advantages of a traditional
relational database, such as scalability, efficiency, and ease of use. This makes an ORD an attractive option for applications that require the handling of complex data 
structures, such as scientific research, financial analysis, and multimedia storage and retrieval.
