It is possible that in the future, we may see fully AI automated ships that are controlled by AI robots without any human involvement. However, it is important to note 
that this level of automation would require significant advances in AI technology, as well as improvements in the reliability and safety of autonomous systems.

Currently, there are already partially autonomous ships that are equipped with advanced navigation and control systems that allow them to operate with reduced human 
intervention. However, fully autonomous ships would require the ability to navigate in a range of conditions and situations, including handling unexpected events and 
making decisions in complex environments.

There are also significant regulatory and safety considerations that would need to be addressed before fully autonomous ships could become a reality. For example, there 
would need to be a clear framework for liability in the event of accidents or malfunctions involving autonomous ships.

In summary, while it is technically possible that fully AI automated ships could be developed in the future, it is likely to be a complex and challenging process that 
will require significant advancements in technology and careful consideration of regulatory and safety issues.

It is difficult to predict with certainty when fully AI autonomous ships that do not require any human influence will be possible, as it depends on various factors such 
as technological advancements, regulatory frameworks, and safety considerations. However, many experts in the field estimate that we may see fully autonomous ships in 
operation by the 2030s or 2040s.

In fact, some companies and research organizations are already working on developing and testing autonomous ships, and there have been successful demonstrations of 
autonomous ships in various settings such as coastal waters, inland waterways, and open seas.

However, it is important to note that the development of fully autonomous ships faces several challenges, such as navigating in complex and changing environments, 
ensuring safety and reliability, and addressing legal and regulatory issues. Therefore, it is likely that the deployment of fully autonomous ships will happen gradually, 
with partial autonomy being implemented first, followed by increased levels of automation as technology and infrastructure continue to improve.

Mayflower 400 is a commemoration of the 400th anniversary of the Mayflower voyage from Plymouth, England, to Plymouth, Massachusetts, which took place in 1620. The 
Mayflower 400 project aims to commemorate the cultural, historical, and social significance of the voyage and its impact on the world.

The project involves a series of events and activities that take place in both England and the United States, including exhibitions, performances, lectures, and tours, 
among others. The main aim of these activities is to explore and celebrate the shared heritage and values of the UK and the US, and to promote cultural and educational 
exchange between the two countries.

The Mayflower 400 project has also highlighted the impact of the Mayflower voyage on the Native American people, whose land and culture were greatly affected by the 
arrival of the Pilgrims in America. As such, the project has also included a range of events and initiatives that aim to promote understanding and reconciliation 
between indigenous peoples and the wider community.

One notable project under the Mayflower 400 initiative was the creation of a new autonomous ship called the Mayflower Autonomous Ship (MAS), which set sail in 2020 
from Plymouth, England to Plymouth, Massachusetts, following the same route as the original Mayflower. The MAS was designed to showcase the latest in autonomous 
shipping technology and its potential applications in scientific research and exploration.
